The WinCUPL code is taken directly from the VHDL made by Thomas 'skoe' Giesel and simply translated into WinCUPL. Skoe made an excellent [description](http://skoe.de/docs/c64-dissected/pla/c64_pla_dissected_r1.1_a4ds.pdf) on the C64 PLA which is very well worth reading.

Yes. I am aware that I did a small mistake in that the JTAG connector doesn't have 0.1" pitch.
